<h1>What Is&nbsp;Selenium-Cucumber?</h1>First what is Selenium, well I'll steel this part straight from the source of truth: (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">http://www.seleniumhq.org/</a>)<br><blockquote><div><p><i>Selenium automates browsers</i>. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.</p></div><div><p>Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.</p></div></blockquote><p>Second Cucumber, because I am lazy I steel this as well: (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)</a>)</p><blockquote><p><b>Cucumber</b>&nbsp;is a software tool that computer programmers use for&nbsp;<b>testing</b>&nbsp;other software. It runs automated acceptance&nbsp;<b>tests</b>&nbsp;written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style.&nbsp;<b>Cucumber</b>&nbsp;is written in the Ruby programming language.<b>Cucumber</b>&nbsp;projects are available for other platforms beyond Ruby.</p></blockquote><br><h1>What are we using this for?</h1><p>Like I said before I am lazy and I hate repeating myself, really hate repeating myself. &nbsp;So we use this to do some automated Web testing and also set this up for mobile web testing.&nbsp;</p><h1>Prerequisites</h1>Firstly let's get all the little bits of software installed, I am running this on a Windows 10 VM, basic 4gb ram, 50gb disk and 2 cores (in now way this the recommended just info on how its setup)<br><br><div><b><u>Must Haves:</u></b></div><ol><li>Download Ruby -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/</a><br>I am using version 2.3.1 64bit</li><li>Devkit which is also downloadable from the above link<br></li><li>Selenium-Cucumber Gem<br><br>The following is required for mobile testing&nbsp;<br></li><li>Java JDK -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html</a><br>Required for Android</li><li>Android&nbsp;SDK&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html">https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html</a><br>I just downloaded the studio which includes the SDK</li><li>Appium -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://appium.io/">https://bitbucket.org/appium/appium.app/downloads/AppiumForWindows.zip</a></li></ol><b><u>Optional:</u></b><br><ol><li>Some text editior, I use sublime -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">https://www.sublimetext.com/3</a><br></li><li>Chrome, Firefox and any of your other browsers</li><li>Chrome driver, you need this for testing in chrome&nbsp;- &nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.9/">http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.9/</a><br></li><li>Internet Explorer driver, again if you want to test in IE -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.42/">http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.42/</a></li><li>Ansicon, this is a cool little tool to give you better&nbsp;readability&nbsp;of the output -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/downloads">https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/downloads</a><br></li><li>Git, as everything should be source controlled -&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a></li></ol><br><br><h1>Install:<br></h1>Installing everything in the same order as above:<br><br><b>Ruby</b>, <br>I won't go through the whole install process but I would suggest the following:<br><img alt="Thumb screen shot 2016 09 12 at 150417" src="/uploads/bootsy/image/58/medium_Screen_Shot_2016-09-12_at_15.04.17.png"><br><br><b>DevKit</b>,&nbsp;<br><ol><li>Download is a self-extracting archive and extract,</li><li><span>Open CMD with Ruby started&nbsp;to that location<br></span><img alt="Thumb screen shot 2016 09 12 at 151038" src="/uploads/bootsy/image/59/medium_Screen_Shot_2016-09-12_at_15.10.38.png"><br><br></li><li>Add Ruby to config file<br><pre><code>c:\devkit\ruby dk.rb init</code></pre><br></li><li>Then install DevKit<br><pre><code>c:\devkit\ruby dk.rb install</code></pre><br></li></ol><b>Selenium-Cucumber</b><br>This is simple from the same cmd just run&nbsp;<b><br></b>gem install&nbsp;Selenium-Cucumber<br><br><b>Java JDK<br></b>I should need to tell anyone how to install this!<br><b><br>Android&nbsp;SDK</b><br>Again simple just install using the installer of the studio using the default options.<br><b><br>Appium</b><br>I will leave this to last as there is a few things to be done.<b><br><br></b><b>Browsers and text editors</b><br>I should need to tell anyone how to install this!<b><br><br></b><b>Chrome and IE Drivers<br></b>Again really simple, I just have a drivers folder in my repos folder and have the exe there. &nbsp;Now add that path to the PATH&nbsp;Environment&nbsp;variable<br><ul><li>Control Panel -&gt;
