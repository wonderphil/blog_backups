<h1>What is PowerShell DSC?</h1>It Microsoft version of Puppet or Chef. So what is DSC, well it stands for&nbsp;Desired State Configuration. &nbsp;DSC provides Powershell with an&nbsp;extension of the PowerShell Cmdlets and configuration files. &nbsp;So what does that mean in the real world terms, means that you can use DSC to configure your servers and manage those servers, its just another tool in a set to help build environment. &nbsp;Should also state that it's not just tried to Windows machines, DSC can work on Linux as well, but I won't be going into that.<br><h1>Architecture</h1><h3>Pull Vs. Push Servers</h3><br>First thing to understand is the difference between Pull and Push servers.<br><h3><b><br>Push Servers: </b>&nbsp;</h3>To quote the PowerShell Team from the Microsoft Blog, "The push model is unidirectional and immediate. &nbsp;The configuration is pushed to its intended targets, and they are configured." (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2013/11/26/push-and-pull-configuration-modes/">Push and Pull Configuration Modes</a>)<br><br>The configuration is started by using the Start-DSCConfiguration cmdlet along with supplying the computer name to configure and the path to&nbsp;configuration files.<br><br><img alt="Thumb push server steps h" src="/uploads/bootsy/image/14/Push-server-steps-H.jpg"><br><br><br><h3><b>Pull Servers:</b> </h3>You have one or many servers setup to host the DSC configurations. &nbsp;Then your clients(machines to be configured) are setup to pull the configuration it needs from said Pull servers.<br><br>Each client then performs a compliance task to keep it-self configure to the correct state, which means any manual configuration of machine will be undone unless its added to your DSC configuration.<br><br><img alt="Thumb pull server steps h" src="/uploads/bootsy/image/16/large_Pull-server-steps-h.jpg"><br><br>First We Author the Configuration:<br><ol><li>Write the Config file<br>Has the basic information required i.e. Configuration Key,&nbsp;Node GUID, Computer Key</li><li>Generate MOF file</li><li>Generate the Checksum of the MOF file, this allows the client to validate the configuration</li><li>Upload each file to the Pull server</li></ol>Secondly we configure the client to Pull from Server.<br><br><br>For now I will be just walking through the Pull Server setup, so I will cover each of the above steps in later blog post.
